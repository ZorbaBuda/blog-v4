summary: It seems that the fastest changes in methylation occur early in our lives, at the very least in the neonatal period, though this thesis is subject to further study. What is important now isthat certain genes which should not be silenced, are. Thus, certain means of expression aresuppressed, which is often the case in depression. None of this means that methylation“causes” the affliction but rather, there are adverse events very early in life that increase itsproduction.

that certain genes which should not be silenced, are. Thus, certain means of expression are
suppressed, which is often the case in depression. None of this means that methylation

Markdown and Mdx parsing is supported via `unified`, and other remark and rehype packages. `next-mdx-remote` allows us to parse `.mdx` and `.md` files in a more flexible manner without touching webpack.

GitHub flavored markdown is used. `mdx-prism` provides syntax highlighting capabilities for code blocks. Here's a demo of how everything looks.

The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

It seems that the fastest changes in methylation occur early in our lives, at the very least in
the neonatal period, though this thesis is subject to further study. What is important now is
that certain genes which should not be silenced, are. Thus, certain means of expression are
suppressed, which is often the case in depression. None of this means that methylation
“causes” the affliction but rather, there are adverse events very early in life that increase its
production.
Though the Canadian researchers emphasize the perinatal period, we have found the
imprint to lie earlier, as well. If the neonate is especially sensitive to environment insults, it
surely is possible that those insults can occur earlier and form the primordial imprint that
later gives rise to depression. Methylation, in brief, offers the primordial event that sets the
prototype for later inhibition and repression; thus, high methylation may be a predictor for
later depression. It means that certain key genes which should find expression are silenced,
especially due to modification of the genes promoter region. The tendencies for no or difficult
expression are imprinted.
My opinion is that some of these changes in physiology occur during our life in the
womb, when the set-points of so many hormones are being established, including thyroid
hormone. Indeed if we give a small does of thyroid medication to depressive patients there is
a transient improvement. One may think that such deficiencies are genetic but there are
events that can cause them that are not always obvious. They are only obvious when the
patient in therapy descends down to the far reaches of the unconscious where the crucial
explanation of one’s depression lies. One again relives the birth experience, the suffocation,
strangulation, the hopeless battle to get out – the unutterable and ineffable despair. Of
course, it is not given a name until years later but the feeling is there engraved in the nervous
system. We can feel hopeless without giving it a label. In the face of adult adversity, the old
imprint – wanting to give up – appears and is now called depression.
We give it that name because we have not seen the generating sources of deep imprinted
despair, something we have observed many times. We name it depression because we do not
know the hopelessness inside that makes us miserable. We give depression the name of the
defense instead of its cause – pain
